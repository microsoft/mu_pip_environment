Version History
===============

0.3.5
-----

Main changes:

- In ConfMgmt, change FindWithVsWhere() to a static method.
- PYTHON_HOME environment variable will automatically be set to the dir path of the Python (sys.executable).

Bug fixes:

- Removing Git submodule VersionAggregation, as this information is contained in the Git commit history. Removing this step cuts several seconds from the beginning of the build.
- You can't have a reference path when doing a clone and saying --recurse-submodules. While it makes zero sense, git throws an error. The retry should be catching this once it goes through as it will try to reclone without the reference path. This does it correctly the first time.

0.3.4
-----

Main changes:

- N/A

Bug fixes:

- Fix for incorrectly using the omnicache even when it wasn't specified. This would cause problems in a server or shallow cloned environment

0.3.3
-----

Main changes:

- Omnicache is a single cache database as a --reference for git repo initialization. See feature_omnicache.md for more information.
- Based on TOOL_CHAIN_TAG, ConfMgmt will attempt to locate a .vs or .gcc conf file before loading the .ms conf file.
- In ConfMgmt __init__, we will now throw an error if WORKSPACE or EDK2_BASE_TOOLS_DIR is not populated yet.
- Significant restructure of MuLogging API surface. Now using named loggers rather than root logger so pieces can be filtered using MuFilter. More info in feature_MuLogging.md.

Bug fixes:

- Linted code base, enforcing a 120 character per line limit.
- Added /.eggs to .gitignore. This directory is only generated when using a local installation of a pip module.

0.3.2
-----

Enabled IntermediateArgParser in CommonBuildEntry, which only scrapes the expected arguments from argparser and stores the rest back in sys.argv to be used later.

0.3.1
-----

- Check submodule.head for type None before reporting it.
- Removing `--name-only` from the `_get_submodule_list` function and retrieving the path instead.

0.3.0
-----

Updated documentation and release process.  Transition to Beta.

< 0.3.0
-------

Alpha development
